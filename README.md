# Deep Clustering Network modified with a U-Net

This is a modification of PyTorch reimplementation of Deep Clustering Network (DCN) (Yang et al, 2017) by Yi-Xuan Xu (https://github.com/xuyxu) from https://github.com/xuyxu/Deep-Clustering-Network.

As Î» increases
- Clustering performance of DCN with dense layers deteriorates slightly
- Clustering performance of DCN with convolutional layers improves slightly

#### Key takeaways

- Convolutional neural networks learn representations faster and better than fully connected neural networks (MLPs)
- Introducing skip connections in the convolutional neural network worsens the clustering performance
- Underlying trade-off between reconstruction and clustering, so optimization objective should be modified to decouple the two
